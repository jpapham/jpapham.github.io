[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://jpapham.github.io/files/JP%20Pham%20CV%20-%20Updated%202024.pdf)

I'm a graduate student working with Dr. Mar√≠a Coronel at the University of Michigan. I completed my B.S. in Bioengineering (Biotechnology) at the University of California San Diego, having worked under Dr. Shengqiang Cai and Dr. Karen Christman.  My research focuses on engineering functionalizable polymer nanoparticles for targeted immunomodulation to improve outcomes in allogeneic organ transplant, specifically for islet transplant for Type I diabetes.
